## Purpose  

Through this data we hoped to find any patterns that could help us make rides more affordable for underserved communities.  

## Results 
### Ride-Sharing Data 
Below is a table illustrating the difference of total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare per city type.

Combing through the data we can see that the least affordable rides are in rural areas. This can be inferred to be because of the ratio of riders to drivers. Rural areas have almost two riders per driver making it the city type with the smallest amount of drivers per rider. On the other hand, we have urban areas with almost 2 drivers per rider. This makes urban areas have the most affordable fare per ride.  

## Summary 

Analyzing the data, it would be in the riders' best interest if the company would hire more drivers in the rural and suburban areas to make the rides more affordable. To keep looking for more patterns to make rides more affordable, it would be helpful to include the distance per ride to see how the prices ratio compares to the other city types.
