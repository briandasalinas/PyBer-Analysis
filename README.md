## Summary
There is a statement summarizing three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types
1. Urban areas offer the most afforable fares per ride since they have the best rider to driver ratio; 1 rider for almost every 2 drivers. For almost every 2 riders there is one driver in the rural areas, making the average fare per driver the most expensive compared to the other types of areas. I would recommend to hire more drivers for the rural and suburban areas to make rides more afforadable. As well as, including distance data for each ride. Rural area might also have more expensive fare per ride due to distance.
